## About
Little Sasha watched her parents die
in a village fire started by a group
of bandits that were passing through.
Her parents had hidden her, and she
remained undiscovered- however she
ended up having to listen and watch
her parents be attacked and left to
burn alive by the bandit group who
were more interested in making a
statement to the other villages.

Despite this dark upbringing- Sasha
remains one of the brightest beams
of sunshine that has ever graced
the surface of the planet Vita.
Her constant upbeat mentality and
mood always empower her sisters in
a way that is unlike anything else.
Often considered the clueless and 
ditzy one, she brought a sense of 
joy and whimsy to the council, 
even in the gravest of times. Her 
infectious laughter and carefree 
spirit served as a reminder to her 
sisters of the importance of finding 
happiness amidst adversity.
