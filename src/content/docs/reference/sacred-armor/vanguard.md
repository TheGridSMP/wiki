# Vanguard 
A hard-hitting glass canon, the Vanguard class is a high-risk/high-reward playstyle.
They are first on the front lines, using hit-and-run tactics due to weak defenses.
The Full Armor set bonus provides two bonuses:

* Bleeding Edge
Gives any sword you wield a serrated edge, which causes bleeding on hit.
  
Costs 0 Energy and has a 1 second cooldown.

* Smoke Bombs
Sneaking will throw down a smoke bomb at your feet, creating a large area of blindness and wither.
  
This costs 30 Energy to use and has a 20-second cooldown.
You are immune to blindness and wither while in your own smoke bomb.

Full Set Stat Bonus:
* + 100 Health
* + 300% Damage Dealt
* + 50% Attack Speed
* + 150% Damage Taken

## Vengence
The preferred dagger of the vanguards, this dagger allows the user to become the Grim Reaper of the battlefield.

* Propulsion Drive
Alt-Click allows the user to engage the kinetic launcher, causing the user to propel forward quickly.

Costs 20 energy and 1.5 seconds cooldown.
