The Skill System revolves around players upgrading their `Frequency of Vita` by travelling, fighting, taking damage and other activities.
For each frequency level you get ***1*** Skill Point (aka `♮ Notes`). `Frequency of Vita` increases regeneration speed and amount of health.

## Lore
This dimension is unique- we don't belong here.
Because of this, we need to attune ourselves to
the frequency of the dimension and planet itself.

Each user/player may attune their frequency to
their own unique specifications, and retuning
is an option that is allowed in the Core for a fee.

Each additional `Frequency of Vita` level gives
Attunement `♮ Notes` and more Vita Energy to use.

## Vita Energy
Users can unlock Vita Energy at `Frequency of Vita` level 10, it is used with Vita Armor and Weapon abilities.
Vita Energy is limited to `100` at start, but can be raised with `Frequency of Vita`.

:::tip[The more you know...]
Vita Energy is calculated by this formula: `100 + (FL x 4)`, where `FL` - `Frequency of Vita` level.
