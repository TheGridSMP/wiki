Deep within the heart of Vita, in a hidden sanctuary, resided the revered Council of the Eight Sisters. These sisters, the eldest and wisest of the Avitazen, were not only esteemed members of their kind but also bestowed with the immense power and knowledge drawn directly from the essence of the land they served.

Each sister possessed unique qualities and played a vital role in the governance of the Avitazen society. Among them, Sashs was the embodiment of innocence and lightheartedness. Often considered the clueless and ditzy one, she brought a sense of joy and whimsy to the council, even in the gravest of times. Her infectious laughter and carefree spirit served as a reminder to her sisters of the importance of finding happiness amidst adversity.

Lyra, on the other hand, epitomized the essence of business and generosity. She was known for her shrewd decision-making and astute judgment. With her keen intellect and diplomatic skills, Lyra negotiated trades, alliances, and ensured the Avitazen thrived. Her acts of kindness and selflessness touched the hearts of all who encountered her, as she used her wealth and resources to uplift the less fortunate and strengthen the bonds within the realm.

The leadership of the council was a matter of balance and harmony, with two sisters sharing the role. Novalyn, with her sassy and classy demeanor, brought a touch of elegance to the council's proceedings. Her sharp wit and quick tongue served as a shield against those who dared to challenge the Avitazen's authority. Novalyn possessed an innate ability to navigate treacherous waters, employing her charm and wit to overcome obstacles and protect her people.

Eve, on the other hand, exuded a more serious and composed demeanor. Her stoic nature and unwavering resolve made her a pillar of strength for her sisters and the Avitazen. She embodied the essence of duty and honor, never shying away from making difficult decisions for the greater good of Vita. Eve's wise counsel and strategic mind were invaluable to the council's deliberations, as she remained steadfast in upholding the traditions and values of their kind.

Riona, one of the sisters, stood out from the others due to her more reserved and prudish nature. Preferring the solace of her catalysts and beloved pets, she found comfort in the quiet contemplation of the land's mysteries. While she rarely ventured outside, her deep understanding of the magical arts and the interplay between souls and nature provided invaluable insights and discoveries that enriched the council's knowledge.

Among the Council of Eight Sisters were also twins, Arenea and Artemis. Though not identical in appearance, their bond was unbreakable. Artemis, known as Arty, possessed an unwavering passion for runes and combat. Her mastery of runic magic and her skills in battle made her an invaluable asset in times of conflict. She tirelessly studied ancient texts and expanded the Avitazen's understanding of the mystical arts.

Arenea, in contrast, possessed a darker and more enigmatic passion. She was fascinated by the harvesting of souls and the creation of powerful artifacts infused with their essence. Arenea's skill in crafting from the souls that Arty brought her led to the creation of unique and potent relics that bolstered the Avitazen's forces. She embraced the shadowy aspects of the Avitazen's existence, seeking a balance between light and dark.

Lastly, there was the eighth sister, the true leader of the council. Her name was whispered with reverence throughout Vita, and her wisdom and guidance were sought in times of dire need. Her name remains shrouded in secrecy, for it is said that only those worthy of her presence may know it.
