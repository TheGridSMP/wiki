## The Archives
Having lived a childhood of extreme combat and
serious trials, young [Ignis](/wiki/reference/world/ignition/) eventually fought
her way up to becoming Queen of [Ignation](/wiki/reference/world/ignition/)- she
was unmatched in agility, speed, and precision.

It wasn't soon after this that [King Prefectus](/wiki/reference/characters/non-players/king-perfectus/)
had launched his incursion to her lands, and
demanded her surrender. Of course, she met him
on the field of battle, and they were evenly
matched, despite an odd sense of 'perfection'
in the King's movements.

Their eventual stalemate led to the King's
admiration of her to finally come through,
and he demanded her hand in marriage. Though
Ignis was no fool, she did not accept his
offer then and there- however over time, she
eventually accepted the King's proposal, and
they were married at the Stony Peaks of Vita.

Sometime after their union and peace between
nations, the King and Queen decided to enter
Obscura, and see what discoveries could be
made to further enhance their strengths.

It was during this incursion, however, that
Detterimus would learn the dark reality
of his pact he made that day with the
corrupted enderman.

One morning their camp was assaulted by a
terribly powerful force of enemies. Their eyes
glowed with a dark purple miasma, and their
onslaught was relentless. The attack was so
overwhelming that the entire King's army was
forced to retreat back to the portal from
where they had entered Obscura from.

The Queen and the King both knew there was no
way they could let that force get back through
to Vita. Queen Ignis made a decision that day
and chose to stay behind, and seal the portal 
from the other side, to protect Vita.

The energy in the air that day was palpable-
as if the planet itself knew what was happening.
And then it happened- King Prefectus smashed the
Eye of Obscura, and sealed the gateway- closing
his beloved inside forever.

Queen Ignis- did not survive this moment, however
she made a bargain with the planet Vita in that
instant. Her life for the planets- and in return
her spirit would be turned into a power that could
find someone powerful enough to stop hold back the
corruption inside Obscura and Vita.

Ignis now lives on as Ignis Arternus, in the hands of
a [one-eyed chemist's bow](/wiki/reference/characters/players/eyes.md).
