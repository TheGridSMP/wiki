A sparking clash between the leader of the Heavenly order, and King Perfectus exploded wildly as her rage towards the king knew no bounds. She was blinded to what was happening below- The King had planned every single step of this, and it was going entirely according to his plan. Suddenly in their next clash, his face changed from a smirk to an expression of momentary irritation as they broke their clash to both dodge a beam from below. It was the shot from the Captain of the Hunters' squad. However, it was not aimed at either of them.

“Sis- NO!” The leader of the Heavenly Order screamed out suddenly as she watched the shot fly past. The King's laughter was drowned out when the cataclysmic shot exploded in the sky above them, blinding the area with a massive light. Blinking forward suddenly next to the face of the Heavenly leader, the King appeared, moving in slow motion, and whispered, “You can’t save all of them…” before disappearing behind her, towards her Heavenly siblings, and continuing his rampage of death.

In a moment of torn conflict and dread, unable to decide what to do, the white lite from the shot began to rain down on the ground below. It was pure beams of lightning destruction. The entire field lit up in the night sky as if it were full daylight at noon. Thousands upon thousands of lightning bolts crashed down from the sky. With a small smile, the Captain of the Hunters squad closed her eyes as the hordes of corrupted forces swamped overhead, watching the biggest beam of lightning aiming straight at her heart.

The shot was a big bang of silence. It ended everything down below. The fields were silent. Bodies lie strewn everywhere in the tall grass, now charred with flesh and bone. What was once a beautiful field in the moonlight, was now a fiery hellscape of absolute death. Reality came crashing back to the leader of the Heavenly Order as she heard her siblings' cries for help from behind her. She blinked on the spot and teleported directly into the blow that was about to end her siblings' lives. With a repulsive burst of energy, the King was shot backward into the forest of trees like a bullet.

“Are you ok, Sasha?” The Heavenly leader asked her friend. “Yeah- thanks to you- he’s just too much…” Sasha replied. The last survivors of the heavenly siblings gathered around them. Including the leader, 8 were all that remained of the Heavenly order. The rest of the Great Schools had all fallen to the ambush.
 
“You all must go- You must leave now.” The leader ordered without hesitation. “We are NOT-” “GO NOW!” Artemis spoke up but was quickly shut down by the leader’s commanding tone. Arenea pulled Artemis back as Riona and Sasha both nodded and began to retreat. They respected their leader too much to disobey a direct command in that tone.

Eve and Novalyn both looked at each other and then again at their leader. “Watch over them-” The leader spoke, in the same tone. The sisters nodded and flew back away with the rest. Lyra, the last one stood quiet as the leader turned and looked at her. “You know what to do-” Lyra nodded in reply. “I do.” The leader looked sharply back to the forest, sensing the king’s return to the fight. “See you then…” The leader spoke, in a softer tone, before teleporting away towards the forest, leaving Lyra to fly away in reply with a nod.
