## Exposition
Couple months after the vita world shift, the energy from the allay-book runs thin and 
releases Duncan with a short timer on all his previous powers and strength. attempting to 
move away from the area is met with the guardian of vita who, like with every other person in 
vita now, tests Duncan to allow his stay in vita. with a mind on the short timer of Duncan’s 
old powers, Duncan beats the guardian who flees and leaves Duncan to roam the area and find 
viable living which would be apparently easy as all his friends have already began 
settlement. By now all Duncan’s previous powers and strength are gone, leaving a dishevelled 
looking Duncan who might need a haircut and some new clothes and cleaning up.
