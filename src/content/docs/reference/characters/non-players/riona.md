## About
Riona truly has no parents that one
could reasonably say they remember.
Ever since Riona could remember, she
was alone and had fended for herself
inside the dark forests of Vita.

Riona became truly talented at befriending
various wildlife, and becoming accepted
by the very creatures that would attack
others around her.

Naturally she had a reasonably healthy
fear of most people, because the same
animals that protected her held that
very same fear.
