description: Everything about the skill system.
---

The Skill System revolves around players upgrading their `Frequency of Vita` by travelling, fighting, taking damage and other activities.
For each frequency level you get ***1*** Skill Point (aka `♮ Notes`). `Frequency of Vita` increases regeneration speed and amount of health.
Although `Frequency of Vita`'s "max" level is 100, no one stops you from advancing it further which is really challenging but gives you ***2*** `♮ Notes` per level!

To use the `♮ Notes` you needd to talk with [Eve](/wiki/reference/characters/non-players/eve/) NPC in [The Core](/wiki/reference/world/the-core/). [Eve](/wiki/reference/characters/non-players/eve/) allows to reset your stats when you hit 100 (or more) `Frequency of Vita` level. Resetting will reset your skills and give you 100 `♮ Notes` back.

:::caution
If you had `Frequency of Vita` level higher than 100, [Eve](/wiki/reference/characters/non-players/eve/) will still give you 100 `♮ Notes` on reset!

## Lore
This dimension is unique- we don't belong here.
Because of this, we need to attune ourselves to
the frequency of the dimension and planet itself.

Each user/player may attune their frequency to
their own unique specifications, and retuning
is an option that is allowed in the Core for a fee.

Each additional `Frequency of Vita` level gives
Attunement `♮ Notes` and more Vita Energy to use.

## Vita Energy
Users can unlock Vita Energy at `Frequency of Vita` level 10, it is used with Vita Armor and Weapon abilities.
Vita Energy is limited to `100` at start, but can be raised with `Frequency of Vita`.

:::tip[The more you know...]
Vita Energy is calculated by this formula: `100 + (FL x 4)`, where `FL` - `Frequency of Vita` level.
