While mods are not generally required, we recommend playing with some Fabric or Quilt mods. They provide optimization and various QoL features that enhance the experience!

## Must-have
It's important for your game to run smoothly and fancy!
We recommend installing [The Grid SMP Official Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/gsmp-official), which has all the recommended mods (and more) installed and configured properly!
