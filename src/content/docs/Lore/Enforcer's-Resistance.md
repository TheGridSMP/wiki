# Enforcer's Resistance

The enemies all retreated at once back into the forest as a tide pulled back out to sea, pulling the bodies of the Vanguards with them. The Enforcers watched all of this go down in a matter of minutes. Less even. As quick as the vanguard was to destroy hundreds of enemies, they were overwhelmed by sheer numbers just as quickly, and just like that, the Vanguard School was wiped out.

The rage and resentment felt inside of every Enforcer watching at the gate was shared unanimously amongst them all. The bandits and forest creatures jeered and screamed from the woods, taunting the city gates and the Enforcers. “Where are the Destroyers?!” Echoes rang out amongst the Enforcers, as they saw the trees themselves come to life and start to move towards the city gates. “The Destroyers are in Ward!” That single line hushed the entire Enforcer lineup. They knew what that meant, and what they must do…

In the main tower of the city was located the Destroyers, and with them, the Heavenly. Magic by nature they were skilled healers, as well as fighters. The main walls of the tower shook as the battle below ensued. Treants could be seen from the windows, smashing against the walls. The head figure of the Heavenly school was in a trance with her brethren. As the walls shook again, and some rocks fell nearby, she closed and focused eyes twitched, knowing something was off.

Down at the city gates, it was everything the Enforcers could do to hold back the onslaught with the protection of the walls, but their numbers were falling. “Where are the Hunters? We need ranged support!!” “The King sent them off to the south on a mi-” The city wall exploded in a massive eruption that shook the entire city.. Only one Enforcer remained, broken and battered on the road to the main gate after being thrown from the walls. His eyes, bleeding from the corners, looked up longingly at the main tower in the city, reaching his hand out towards it- as a massive tree slammed on his body, shattering any life remaining inside him.

The head of the Heavenly School’s eyes popped open right that very moment- Her brother's death awakened her from the healing trance she was encased in with her other Heavenly School siblings. She rushed to the window and looked out over the city, her wings braced for battle behind her. As the smoke arose from the streets below, waves of corrupted forces were seen pouring through the city gate. Her vision scanned the decimated structures until she found her brother's corpses, and with a panicked eye, saw various Vanguard cloaks around as well.

Falling back from the window with a gasp, she was caught by strong hands behind her, the newly awoken commander of the Destroyer Brigade, who looked out the window in front of her. “So he made his move…” The commander thought as he lightly nodded his head, sternly looking out over the destruction. The Heavenly leader looked at him in surprise as he projected his thoughts into her mind, and she shook her head, not waiting to accept it. The corrupted forces were getting closer to the main tower, and seemed to be ignoring the villagers in the houses nearby entirely. It was clear they were here for them, and them alone.
