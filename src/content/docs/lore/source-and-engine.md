### *The Essence of World Building*
## The Source and The Engine
Generally, every reality has an Engine and a Source.

The Engines are people or objects, that had created The Source. They are usually very powerful and have direct connection to their Source. While it may be obvious that The Engine should be sentient, it's not always true. Some Engines use their primal instincts to survive.

The Source is usually an object, that possess some intellect whether The Engine was sentient or not, created by The Engine. The Sources usually create various lifeforms to protect itself.

It's also important to say, that if The Source loses the connection or trust in The Engine, it can block The Engine's powers via resonation.
