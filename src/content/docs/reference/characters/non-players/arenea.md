## About
Twins with Artemis, though not identical-
These blood sisters knew the hardships
of the world from a young age, after
their parents abandoned them for some gold.

Arenea got into some dark magics early on,
and this led to a bad accident one night
which caused Artemis to damage her eye
while protecting her sister.

However, these trials led to Arenea
mastering the premier artistry of souls.
This meant true soul manipulation and
transplanting. fpr anyone or anything.
