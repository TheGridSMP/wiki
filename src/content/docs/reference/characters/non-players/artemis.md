## About
Twins with Arenea, but not identical-
These natural sisters grew up together
always on the run in some form or another.
Their parents abandoned them at a young
age, so they relied on each other.

Artemis was very skilled at picking
pockets as a child, and this led her to
have a fascination with gems and runes.
After a while, her talents grew into
powerful skills that became one of a kind.

Her fighting prowess was one of the top
in all of Vita- and it was a very rare
day that anyone or anything ever bested
her in combat.
