One of the 8 Sisters

Sasha is an only child

Sasha was the embodiment of innocence and lightheartedness. Often considered the clueless and ditzy one, she brought a sense of joy and whimsy to the council, even in the gravest of times. Her infectious laughter and carefree spirit served as a reminder to her sisters of the importance of finding happiness amidst adversity.
