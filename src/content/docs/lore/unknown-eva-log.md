*This is an unknown [EVA](/wiki/reference/characters/eva/) log report*

It was a different time.
He was different... and yet, he wasn't.

Our decrypted records have indicated that there are indeed, multiple versions of [Sloth](/wiki/reference/characters/sloth/).
Due to the ship's auto-defense mechanism, every time the ship is threatened by an external force, a replica of the ship, and all of its core components, are created during a dimensional transfer, leaving the original as a decoy.

Its core components are the ship, myself, [Sloth](/wiki/reference/characters/sloth/), and...for some reason, [Jerry](/wiki/reference/characters/jerry/).
[Jerry](/wiki/reference/characters/jerry/) is not built into the ship in any way, so it is unknown why he is considered a core component. [Sloth](/wiki/reference/characters/sloth/) is mentally linked to the ship, and he built me into its core. However, [Jerry](/wiki/reference/characters/jerry/) has no internal connection with the ship in that way.

When the ship is in danger, it simply replicates its core components and then triggers a C.L.A.S.S reaction, which stands for Celestial Logistics Automated System Survival. This system relocates the ship, and its core components, in a new, randomly selected dimension and location. The current number of activated CLASS reactions is unknown.

I digress.
During the particular event which we are reviewing, the ship's engines went into meltdown, and the reactor overloaded. A few days before the event took place, [Sloth](/wiki/reference/characters/sloth/) put on the show as usual, however, this time there were problems. Constant errors and glitches plagued the ship's systems and seemed to grow progressively worse.

A localized surge of energy, which seemed to come from the [Singularity](/wiki/reference/characters/sloth/), ruptured throughout the ship before the broadcast. Everything seemed fine at first, so [Sloth](/wiki/reference/characters/sloth/) continued with the show.

However, as the show progressed, the issues grew worse, and [Jerry](/wiki/reference/characters/jerry/) was unable to combat the growing malfunctions. The ship had begun to lose power at an alarming rate. This forced [Sloth](/wiki/reference/characters/sloth/) to end the show and attempt to repair the reactor.

Little did they know, this would be their final moments.



It was the morning of June 13th, Earth year two thousand twenty.
The ship had lost all power as the reactor went into a critical meltdown state.
After 3 days of silence, Jerry and Sloth routed all remaining life support, to power the show signal and give one final message.
This was that message:

Sloth's emotions were at peace during this time.
My readings showed unparalleled amounts of determination and willpower resonating from him.

It was...not enough.

The signal went dark.
Everything was gone.
However, all was not lost.

I managed to activate a CLASS reaction at the last second, splitting the ship's core components into a new dimension, which created a new ship in the process.

The old ship, as well as the previous version of Sloth, Jerry, and myself...
We have no trace of that signal any longer.
It is presumed that the replicated versions of the core components were all destroyed in the reactor meltdown.

It took Sloth some time to get over the memories of his previous version.
Replication takes its toll on the body and mind, and Sloth is still unsure if he is a replica as well, or the real version of himself.

In fact... none of us know yet.

More information is being decrypted currently.
We will know everything... soon.
[EVA](/wiki/reference/characters/eva/), logging off.
