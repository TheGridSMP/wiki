King Prefectus (Part 1)
From a young age, Deterrimus was always the
weakest among anyone that he encountered.
An orphan from birth, raised by beggars,
pursued by animals and bandits, beaten
down by groups of villagers for bringing
misfortune to their village, and more...

One day Deterrimus came across a dying
enderman, who had very mysterious marks.
The enderman made him a deal, for the
perfect power, and ultimate dominance
of anything he desired- Unable to say no
to such an offer after the past he endured,
Deterrimus agreed to the deal.

The enderman hissed a terrible laugh before
being torn back into Obscura form where he
had come from- And just like that, from that
day forward, Deterrimus began to have perfect
luck in everything he decided to do!

This all led him to growing incredibly powerful,
and inevitably become the King of the Avitazens.
He changed his name to Prefectus then, to reflect
his newfound, unstoppable lifestyle.

However this would lead to some very dark days
for the King.

Sometime after the King obtained his status,
he led the armies of the Avitazens to conquer
the linked hellscape of Ignation- however in
their invasion, the King instead found love
in the battle with Queen Ignis, of Ignation.

Her power impressed King Prefectus so much
that he called off his attack, and promptly
asked for her hand in marriage. Queen Ignis made
him work for it, of course, but eventually they
united forces in wedlock, and the union was sealed. 


The night of their incursion into Obscura, the
King had gotten a visitor late at night in his
quarters. It was the enderman with weird marks
all over his body- marks of corruption...

Deterrimus was told that it was time to collect
and he had to uphold his end of the bargain for
his abilities of ultimate foresight and enhanced
strength. That deal- was that he must betray the
one he loved the most- The corrupted enderman
demanded a soul as powerful as the Kings, in
return for granting him those gifts.

Deterrimus was distraught, and absolutely refused
the deal- demanding that he be taken instead.
However the corruption refused, and told the King
that it would be a choice, in the end.

The King did not realize this choice was to be
made by Queen Ignis. Her insistence on staying
behind to cover the retreat and seal the portal
was not an argument the King could even win-
however he chose to let her stay alone...

In the end, the King made his choice, as did
Queen Ignis- just as the corruption has foretold.
When the portal destabilized, and the dust settled,
the King was beyond distraught, to the point he
refused to leave his chambers for years.

Eventually a gnawing, persistent voice, would eat
away at the Deterrimus's sanity while he isolated
himself from the world. It was his fault, and it
was not his fault- but it was his fault- he told
himself over and over, until one day, many years
later...he broke...

That was the day, The Great War of Vita began...
