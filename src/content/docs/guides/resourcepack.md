The resource pack is an important part of the experience. Most custom stuff requires the resource pack to be enabled, so make sure to allow it when the server asks you to download the resource pack!
> Q: Ughh... but what if i dont want to wait 3000 hours loading a resource pack!
> A: Easy! Don't load it! No, really, just install [Resource Pack Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/resource-pack-tweaks) and it will automatically load the resourcepack once you start Minecraft! (Read more about recommended mods [here](/wiki/guides/mods/))


## OST Packs
OST Packs replace minecraft's background music with something more fitting for the SMP.
You can get the OST packs on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/54t4xtb5p8) in [the info channel](https://discord.com/channels/622463412290453504/1107014906789773372).
The first OST Pack replaces overworld music, while others replace nether and end music.
