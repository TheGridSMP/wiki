## About
Blood sisters with Novalyn, Eve is younger.
Though being the younger sibling didn't
stop Eve from working her way up in the
villagers taverns and high courts.

Eve was a master of many traits, and she
used every single one of them to communicate
with people and command a strong sense of
leadership wherever she went.

She retains a natural sense of leadership
among all of the Council of Sisters whenever
Avita is not among them.
