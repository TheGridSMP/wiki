## A Fleeting Dream

 "Ugh-" I muttered as the blazing sun assults 
 my eyes. I cover my eyes from it's pressence.
 As I rose up from the earth I began to 
 wonder "where am I" "Who am I". I recall 
 the sweetest dream, such splendor and beauty. 
 Lands that scrape the heavens, and worlds 
 that shattered among all. But was it 
 really a dream? Where am I, Who am I?
 "Wake up, Dreamer"
