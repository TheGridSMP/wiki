While mods are not generally required, we still recommend you to play with some Fabric or Quilt mods. They provide optimization and various QoL features that enhance the experience of the game.

## Must-have
It's important for your game to run smoothly and fancy!
We recommend installing [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack, which has all the recommended mods (and more) installed and configured properly! We also recommend installing [Resource Pack Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/resource-pack-tweaks), which automatically loads server pack!
